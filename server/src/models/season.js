/**
 * Season Model
 * Captures the essence of a basketball season, associating it with a specific year. It records the roster of players
 * participating in that season, along with references to all the games and practice sessions that take place. This model
 * serves as a central point for aggregating detailed seasonal activities, facilitating easy access to comprehensive data
 * on player participation, game outcomes, and practice efficiency. The structure supports dynamic updates as the season
 * progresses, with new games and practices being added.
