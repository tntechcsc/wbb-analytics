/**
 * Shot Model
 * This schema represents each shot attempt within a game, linking to both the game and the player who took the shot. 
 * It records whether the shot was made or missed, the court zone from which the shot was taken, the time left on the 
 * shot clock, and the exact timestamp of the attempt. This detailed tracking enables analysis of shooting performance 
 * and decision-making under various game conditions.
