/**
 * Tempo Model
 * Represents a tempo event within a basketball game or practice session. Each tempo event is associated
 * with a specific game, involves multiple players, and is characterized by its type (offensive or defensive),
 * the time it takes for the transition to occur, and the exact timestamp of the event. This model facilitates
 * tracking the speed and efficiency of team transitions during gameplay.
