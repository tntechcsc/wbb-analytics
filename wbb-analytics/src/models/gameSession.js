/**
 * Game Model
 * Defines the structure for documents representing basketball games within a season. Each game is linked to a season, 
 * includes details like the date, opponent, and location, and tracks specific events such as tempos and shots. This model 
 * allows for detailed recording and analysis of game dynamics, player performances, and team strategies through the 
 * association of tempo and shot event data. It serves as a comprehensive record of each game's circumstances and outcomes.
